               data, and their relationship, built on top of a versatile system
               for data logistics (git-annex) and the most popular distributed
               version control system (Git). It adapts principles of open-source
               software development and distribution to address the technical
               challenges of data management, data sharing, and digital
               provenance collection across the life cycle of digital objects.
               DataLad aims to make data management as easy as managing code. It
               streamlines procedures to consume, publish, and update data, for
               data of any size or type, and to link them as precisely
               versioned, lightweight dependencies. DataLad helps to make
               science more reproducible and FAIR (Wilkinson et al., 2016). It
               can capture complete and actionable process provenance of data
               transformations to enable automatic re-computation. The DataLad
               project (datalad.org) delivers a completely open, pioneering
               platform for flexible decentralized research data management
               (RDM) (Hanke, Pestilli, et al., 2021). It features a Python and a
               command-line interface, an extensible architecture, and does not
               depend on any centralized services but facilitates
               interoperability with a plurality of existing tools and services.
               In order to maximize its utility and target audience, DataLad is
               available for all major operating systems, and can be integrated
               into established workflows and environments with minimal
               friction.",

               to the challenges raised by data-heavy, compute-intensive
               neuroimaging research. CBRAIN offers transparent access to remote
               data sources, distributed computing sites, and an array of
               processing and visualization tools within a controlled, secure
               environment. Its web interface is accessible through any modern
               browser and uses graphical interface idioms to reduce the
               technical expertise required to perform large-scale computational
               analyses. CBRAIN's flexible meta-scheduling has allowed the
               incorporation of a wide range of heterogeneous computing sites,
               currently including nine national research High Performance
               Computing (HPC) centers in Canada, one in Korea, one in Germany,
               and several local research servers. CBRAIN leverages remote
               computing cycles and facilitates resource-interoperability in a
               transparent manner for the end-user. Compared with typical grid
               solutions available, our architecture was designed to be easily
               extendable and deployed on existing remote computing sites with
               no tool modification, administrative intervention, or special
               software/hardware configuration. As October 2013, CBRAIN serves
               over 200 users spread across 53 cities in 17 countries. The
               platform is built as a generic framework that can accept data and
               analysis tools from any discipline. However, its current focus is
               primarily on neuroimaging research and studies of neurological
               diseases such as Autism, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases,
               Multiple Sclerosis as well as on normal brain structure and

              vendor-neutral acquisition and tested the hypothesis that
              vendor-neutral sequences decrease inter-vendor variability of T1,
              magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and magnetization transfer
              saturation-index (MTsat) measurements. METHODS: We developed and
              deployed a vendor-neutral 3D spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) sequence
              on three clinical scanners by two MRI vendors. We then acquired T1
              maps on the ISMRM-NIST system phantom, as well as T1, MTR, and
              MTsat maps in three healthy participants. We performed
              hierarchical shift function analysis in vivo to characterize the
              differences between scanners when the vendor-neutral sequence is
              used instead of commercial vendor implementations. Inter-vendor
              deviations were compared for statistical significance to test the
              hypothesis. RESULTS: In the phantom, the vendor-neutral sequence
              reduced inter-vendor differences from 8\% to 19.4\% to 0.2\% to
              5\% with an overall accuracy improvement, reducing ground truth T1
              deviations from 7\% to 11\% to 0.2\% to 4\%. In vivo, we found
              that the variability between vendors is significantly reduced (p =
              0.015) for all maps (T1, MTR, and MTsat) using the vendor-neutral
              sequence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that vendor-neutral workflows
              are feasible and compatible with clinical MRI scanners. The
              significant reduction of inter-vendor variability using
              vendor-neutral sequences has important implications for qMRI
              research and for the reliability of multicenter clinical trials.",

               the container runtime (e.g., Docker, Singularity) runs. This
               approach, however, does not easily scale to large images and
               thousands of nodes. CVMFS has long been used for the efficient
               distribution of software directory trees at a global scale. In
               order to extend its optimized caching and network utilization to
               the distribution of containers, CVMFS recently implemented a
               dedicated container image ingestion service together with
               container runtime integrations. CVMFS ingestion is based on
               per-file deduplication, instead of the per-layer deduplication
               adopted by traditional container registries. On the client-side,
               CVMFS implements on-demand fetching of the chunks required for
               the execution of the container instead of the whole image.",

               which took its rise in 1657, but lived only ten years. The Royal
               Society is, then, the oldest corporate body of its kind to have
               enjoyed continuous existence until today. In a like way the
               Philosophical Transactions was not the earliest scientific
               periodical to come forth, since the first number of the Journal
               des Sçavans appeared, on 5 January 1665, two months before the
               first number of the Transactions . The Journal , however, while
               much concerned with scientific matters, including scientific
               books, dealt with the world of learning in general, including
               literary, legal and theological matters. Its pronouncements often
               led to stormy controversy, it had a troubled history and finally
               ceased to appear in 1790. The Transactions , except for a short
               break when it was replaced by Hooke’s Philosophical Collections ,
               and for an interruption of three years that followed the landing
               of William of Orange and the flight of James II, has been

               March 1664/5, the present year thus being the three hundredth

               Oldenburg, a character very much to the fore in the early history

               of information communication, including scholarly communication.
               The immediacy that characterizes publishing information to the
               web, as well as accessing it, allows for a dramatic increase in
               the speed of dissemination of scholarly knowledge. But, the
               transition from a paper-based to a web-based scholarly
               communication system also poses challenges. In this paper, we
               focus on reference rot, the combination of link rot and content
               drift to which references to web resources included in Science,
               Technology, and Medicine (STM) articles are subject. We
               investigate the extent to which reference rot impacts the ability
               to revisit the web context that surrounds STM articles some time
               after their publication. We do so on the basis of a vast
               collection of articles from three corpora that span publication
               years 1997 to 2012. For over one million references to web
               resources extracted from over 3.5 million articles, we determine
               whether the HTTP URI is still responsive on the live web and
               whether web archives contain an archived snapshot representative
               of the state the referenced resource had at the time it was
               referenced. We observe that the fraction of articles containing
               references to web resources is growing steadily over time. We
               find one out of five STM articles suffering from reference rot,
               meaning it is impossible to revisit the web context that
               surrounds them some time after their publication. When only
               considering STM articles that contain references to web
               resources, this fraction increases to seven out of ten. We
               suggest that, in order to safeguard the long-term integrity of
               the web-based scholarly record, robust solutions to combat the
               reference rot problem are required. In conclusion, we provide a
               brief insight into the directions that are explored with this
               regard in the context of the Hiberlink project.",

               software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the
               software submitted and providing a mechanism for research
               software developers to receive credit. While designed to work
               within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the
               dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the
               form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate
               scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous
               peer review targets the software components: functionality,
               documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A
               JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and
               functionality of the software, references, and a link to the
               software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS
               submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts.
               Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors,
               reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike
               other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major
               revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and
               under review until the authors make adequate changes (or
               withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is
               accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI),
               deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin
               collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other
               services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article,
               releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
               International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016,

               disparate platforms can be browsed, searched, accessed, and
               shared in accordance with FAIR principles. Another key piece of
               CONP infrastructure is NeuroLibre, a preprint server capable of
               creating and hosting executable and fully reproducible scientific
               publications that embed text, figures, and code. As part of its
               holistic approach, the CONP has also constructed frameworks and
               guidance for ethics and data governance, provided support and
               developed resources to help train the next generation of
               neuroscientists, and has fostered and grown an engaged community

              but its tissue-specific values remain inconsistent across
              protocols, sites, and vendors. The ISMRM Reproducible Research and
              Quantitative MR study groups jointly launched a challenge to
              assess the reproducibility of a well-established
              inversion-recovery T1 mapping technique, using acquisition details
              from a seminal T1 mapping paper on a standardized phantom and in
              human brains. METHODS: The challenge used the acquisition protocol
              from Barral et al. (2010). Researchers collected T1 mapping data
              on the ISMRM/NIST phantom and/or in human brains. Data submission,
              pipeline development, and analysis were conducted using
              open-source platforms. Intersubmission and intrasubmission
              comparisons were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen submissions (39
              phantom and 56 human datasets) on scanners by three MRI vendors
              were collected at 3 T (except one, at 0.35 T). The mean
              coefficient of variation was 6.1\% for intersubmission phantom
              measurements, and 2.9\% for intrasubmission measurements. For
              humans, the intersubmission/intrasubmission coefficient of
              variation was 5.9/3.2\% in the genu and 16/6.9\% in the cortex. An
              interactive dashboard for data visualization was also developed:
              https://rrsg2020.dashboards.neurolibre.org. CONCLUSION: The T1
              intersubmission variability was twice as high as the
              intrasubmission variability in both phantoms and human brains,
              indicating that the acquisition details in the original paper were
              insufficient to reproduce a quantitative MRI protocol. This study
              reports the inherent uncertainty in T1 measures across independent
              research groups, bringing us one step closer to a practical
              clinical baseline of T1 variations in vivo.",

                  intelligence of artificial systems via a set of unique, novel
                  tasks only requiring minimal prior knowledge. While ARC-AGI
                  has spurred significant research activity over the past five
                  years, recent AI progress calls for benchmarks capable of
                  finer-grained evaluation at higher levels of cognitive
                  complexity. We introduce ARC-AGI-2, an upgraded version of the
                  benchmark. ARC-AGI-2 preserves the input-output pair task
                  format of its predecessor, ensuring continuity for
                  researchers. It incorporates a newly curated and expanded set
                  of tasks specifically designed to provide a more granular
                  signal to assess abstract reasoning and problem-solving

                  contextualize the difficulty and characteristics of ARC-AGI-2,

                  robust baseline that highlights the benchmark's accessibility
                  to human intelligence, yet difficulty for current AI systems.
                  ARC-AGI-2 aims to serve as a next-generation tool for

               efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more
               important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language
               of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements,
               especially as a compilation target. Engineers from the four major
               browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively
               designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It
               offers compact representation, efficient validation and
               compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than
               committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an
               abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-,
               and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web.
               WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the
               start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of
               WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with
               implementations.",

               proprietary barriers and inconsistent implementations, which
               prevent the establishment of measurement uncertainties. As a
               result, biomedical studies that rely on these methods are plagued
               by systematic variance, undermining the perceived promise of
               quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs) and hindering their
               clinical translation. This review explores the added value of
               open-source measurement pipelines in minimizing variability
               sources that would otherwise remain unknown. First, we introduce
               a tiered benchmarking framework (from black-box to glass-box)
               that exposes how opacity at different workflow stages propagates
               measurement uncertainty. Second, we provide a concise glossary to
               promote consistent terminology for strategies that enhance
               reproducibility before acquisition or enable valid post-hoc
               pooling of QIBs. Building on this foundation, we present two
               illustrative measurement workflows that decouple workflow logic
               from the orchestration of computational processes in an MRI
               measurement pipeline, rooted in the core principles of modularity
               and portability. Designed as accessible entry points for
               implementation, these examples serve as practical guides, helping
               users adapt the frameworks to their specific needs and
               facilitating collaboration. Through critical evaluation of
               existing approaches, we discuss how standardized workflows can
               help identify outstanding challenges in translating glass-box
               frameworks into clinical scanner environments. Ultimately,
               achieving this goal will require coordinated efforts from QIB
               developers, regulators, industry partners, and clinicians alike.",

               in the journals of these major publishers, as well as its
               evolution over time and across various disciplines, has not yet
               been analyzed. This paper provides such analysis, based on 45
               million documents indexed in the Web of Science over the period
               1973-2013. It shows that in both natural and medical sciences
               (NMS) and social sciences and humanities (SSH), Reed-Elsevier,
               Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, and Taylor \& Francis increased their
               share of the published output, especially since the advent of the
               digital era (mid-1990s). Combined, the top five most prolific
               publishers account for more than 50\% of all papers published in

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Jupyter notebooks facilitate the bundling of
               executable code with its documentation and output in one
               interactive environment, and they represent a popular mechanism
               to document and share computational workflows, including for
               research publications. The reproducibility of computational
               aspects of research is a key component of scientific
               reproducibility but has not yet been assessed at scale for
               Jupyter notebooks associated with biomedical publications.
               APPROACH: We address computational reproducibility at 2 levels:
               (i) using fully automated workflows, we analyzed the
               computational reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks associated
               with publications indexed in the biomedical literature repository
               PubMed Central. We identified such notebooks by mining the
               article's full text, trying to locate them on GitHub, and
               attempting to rerun them in an environment as close to the
               original as possible. We documented reproduction success and
               exceptions and explored relationships between notebook
               reproducibility and variables related to the notebooks or
               publications. (ii) This study represents a reproducibility
               attempt in and of itself, using essentially the same methodology
               twice on PubMed Central over the course of 2 years, during which
               the corpus of Jupyter notebooks from articles indexed in PubMed
               Central has grown in a highly dynamic fashion. RESULTS: Out of
               27,271 Jupyter notebooks from 2,660 GitHub repositories
               associated with 3,467 publications, 22,578 notebooks were written
               in Python, including 15,817 that had their dependencies declared
               in standard requirement files and that we attempted to rerun
               automatically. For 10,388 of these, all declared dependencies
               could be installed successfully, and we reran them to assess
               reproducibility. Of these, 1,203 notebooks ran through without
               any errors, including 879 that produced results identical to
               those reported in the original notebook and 324 for which our
               results differed from the originally reported ones. Running the
               other notebooks resulted in exceptions. CONCLUSIONS: We zoom in
               on common problems and practices, highlight trends, and discuss
               potential improvements to Jupyter-related workflows associated
               with biomedical publications.",

                  content published in different formats: manuscripts,
                  presentations, posters and computational notebooks. The need
                  to track versions to accommodate for the
                  write--review--rebut--revise life-cycle adds another layer of
                  complexity. We propose to significantly reduce this burden by
                  maintaining a single source document in a version-controlled
                  environment (such as git), adding functionality to generate a
                  collection of output formats popular in academia. To this end,
                  we utilise various open-source tools from the Jupyter
                  scientific computing ecosystem and operationalise selected
                  software engineering concepts. We offer a proof-of-concept
                  workflow that composes Jupyter Book (an online document),
                  Jupyter Notebook (a computational narrative) and reveal.js
                  slides from a single markdown source file. Hosted on GitHub,
                  our approach supports change tracking and versioning, as well
                  as a transparent review process based on the underlying code
                  issue management infrastructure. An exhibit of our workflow

               thousands of years, in many roles, with regional variation. In
               material culture, its wood has assisted in hunting and warfare
               for over seven thousand years; but more importantly, its leaves
               and bark were semi-indispensible for the production of milk and
               meat, and served as an emergency food for humans. In the
               Mediterranean, elm was the main tool for the production of a good
               quality wine by providing support for the grapevine, and it
               helped feeding the cattle. These functions sometimes found an
               echo in the non-material culture. The fact that in Germanic
               genesis stories the first woman was created out of an elm (the
               man out of an ash), as well as a severe local taboo on the use of
               elm wood for skis, threatening the offender with a place in hell,
               seem both connected to the superior feeding value of this tree.
               In England and in parts of continental Europe most sacred trees
               were elms, sometimes performing female functions such as the
               production of babies. In the Mediterranean, however, the elm was
               seen as the male partner in the “marriage of the vine to the
               elm”, which was the celebrated system of viticulture. That image
               has been used by poets and politicians over the ages to praise
               the effects of human marriage, cooperation and interdependence.
               It even forms the core of the apocryphal Bible book “The
               Shepherd”, where it is seen as a symbol and example for a kind of
               symbiosis between the rich and the poor. - In conclusion, the
               ultimate origin of the English elm or “Atinia”, as well as its
               discovery is discussed, which appears to be a question of milk
               and wine.",

              regard to its limitations and utility for academic writing,
              education, and programming. We end with our stance with regard to
              using LLMs and chatbots in academia, which is summarized as (1) we
              must find ways to effectively use them, (2) their use does not
              constitute plagiarism (although they may produce plagiarized
              text), (3) we must quantify their bias, (4) users must be cautious
